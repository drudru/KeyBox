# Fonts

Currently the system is using the bitmap font from a
[Wyse 700 Video Card](http://www.seasip.info/VintagePC/wy700.html)
from the 1980s.

The other font in the directory is not used.
It is from the [IBM Model 5271 PC](http://www.seasip.info/VintagePC/5271.html).
This was an IBM PC that emulated an IBM 3270 terminal.
