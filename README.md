KeyBox Project
--------------

The KeyBox project is the software side of the KeyBox device.
The software combined with a Raspberry Pi Zero will hold your passwords and allow
you to play them back by emulating a USB keyboard.

The device will also emulate and ssh-agent and allow you to keep all of your ssh keys
securely on this device.

This is the central repository for the KeyBox project.
It will have pointers to other repos necessary to build the KeyBox distribution.

All software should be under an MIT or similar open source license.
