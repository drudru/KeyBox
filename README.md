KeyBox Project
--------------

The KeyBox project combines a Raspberry Pi Zero, a small TFT display, and some software
into a device that holds passwords and cryptographic keys.

The will hold your passwords and allow you to play them back by emulating a USB keyboard.

The device will also emulate and ssh-agent and allow you to keep all of your ssh keys
securely on this device.

This is the central repository for the KeyBox project.
It will have pointers to other repos necessary to build the KeyBox distribution.

All software should be under an MIT or similar open source license.

If you have any questions, please open an issue.
